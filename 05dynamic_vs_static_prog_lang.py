# Characteristics of Python programming language
# Dynamic vs Static Programming Languages
# Interpreted vs Compiled languages
# High level vs Low level languages 


# Python code -- bitcode -- Machine code


# Advantages and disadvantages of static and dynamic PL
# Dynamic Programming Language:
# Advantages:

#     More flexible and easier to change code during runtime.
#     Better for interactive development and prototyping.
#     Often easier to read and write code compared to statically typed languages.

# Disadvantages:

#     Can lead to runtime errors due to type mismatches.
#     Slower performance compared to statically typed languages.
#     More difficult to debug and maintain large codebases.

# Static Programming Language:
# Advantages:

#     Type checking helps catch errors early in the development process.
#     Better performance compared to dynamically typed languages.
#     Easier to optimize code for performance.

# Disadvantages:

#     Strict type checking can make code more verbose.
#     Can be less flexible and harder to change code during runtime.
#     Can be more difficult to write code compared to dynamically typed languages.
